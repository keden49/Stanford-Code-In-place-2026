High-Low Game

We want you to gain more experience working with control flow and Booleans in Python. To do this, we are going to have you develop a game! The game is called High-Low and the way it's played goes as follows:

1. Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You get to see your number, but not the computer's!

2. You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number

3. If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!

These steps make up one round of the game. The game is over after all rounds have been played.


NOTE: For the autograder to work, make sure you generate the computer's number FIRST, then the user's number.



Here's a sample run of the game where we play three rounds (user input is in blue for visual clarity):

```bash

Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
Round 1
Your number is 8
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 35
Your score is now 1

Round 2
Your number is 88
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 100
Your score is now 1

Round 3
Your number is 63
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
You were right! The computer's number was 5
Your score is now 2

Round 4
Your number is 19
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 27
Your score is now 3

Round 5
Your number is 71
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 55
Your score is now 3

Thanks for playing!

To help out, we've made some milestones to guide you. 



Milestone #1: Generate the random numbers

Generate the random numbers for you and the computer. For now, print both of them out to help you test the logic in later milestones. NOTE: For the autograder to work, make sure you generate the computer's number FIRST, then the user's number. Your output should look like this (with different random numbers):

```bash
Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
The computer's number is 23
Your number is 82
```


Milestone #2: Get user choice

Get user input for their choice of whether they think their number is higher or lower than the computer's number.

```bash
Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
The computer's number is 7
Your number is 17
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher

```

Milestone #3: Write the game logic

Write code that maps out all the ways to win the round and prints out the results. When does the user win? How might we check for this? (Note: If you and the computer share the same number, the computer should win since your number wouldn't be higher nor lower.)

```bash
Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
The computer's number is 79
Your number is 3
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 79
```


(Example case for when you and the computer have the same number)
```bash
Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
The computer's number is 57
Your number is 57
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 57
```


Milestone #4: Play multiple rounds

Milestones 1-3 make up a single round of the game. Now that your game logic is sound, you can remove the line printing out the computer's number. Next, write code to play multiple rounds of the game! How many rounds should they play you ask? We've provided you with the NUM_ROUNDS constant. NUM_ROUNDS is the number of rounds you should have the user play. For reference, in the first example, we had NUM_ROUNDS = 5. After each round, add a blank line to separate the rounds visually. Make sure to print out the round number as well!

```bash

Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
Round 1
Your number is 22
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 23

Round 2
Your number is 76
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 81

... (more rounds are played)
```


Milestone #5: Adding a points system and a thank you!

Keep track of the player's score! You should print out the player's score after each round. After they finish all the rounds, say thank you! After this step, you will have coded up the entire game! 

```bash
Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
Round 1
Your number is 22
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 23
Your score is now 1

Round 2
Your number is 76
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 81
Your score is now 1

... (more rounds are played)

Round 5
Your number is 88
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
You were right! The computer's number was 35
Your score is now 3

Thanks for playing!
```
